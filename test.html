 6  Welcome to my personal and professional portfolio!

 8  I am Francis Sebastian J. Quezon, a seasoned Python Data 
 9  Engineer with a strong background in software development
10  and data engineering. I have over four years of experience 
11  in various industries, primarily focusing on creating 
12  efficient data pipelines, API integrations, and custom
13  solutions using Python.
14
15  My expertise includes developing custom Airbyte connectors,
16  maintaining test frameworks, and working with Amazon 
17  Redshift for complex data tasks. I am also proficient in 
18  frameworks like Django and Flask, which I’ve used in both 
19  full-stack and data engineering projects.
20
21  I recently relocated to Melbourne, Australia, where I am 
22  excited to continue my journey in the tech industry, bringing 
23  my knowledge of Python, data engineering, and API design to 
24  new challenges. I’m also exploring opportunities to delve 
25  deeper into AI development, an area I am passionate about.
26
27  Beyond my professional life, I am committed to continuous 
28  learning, particularly in areas that push the boundaries of 
29  technology. I enjoy solving complex problems and strive to 
30  create solutions that are not only effective but elegant.
31
32  Feel free to explore my portfolio, where you will find projects 
33  showcasing my work, contributions, and the creative solutions 
34  I’ve developed over the years. Whether you’re here to 
35  collaborate, learn, or simply get inspired, I’m glad you stopped by!
